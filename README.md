# affirm
Ben Raz, 2023
## What does it do?
`affirm` takes in an input and then repeats it infinitely. To learn more, run 
```zsh
% affirm -h
```
## Why?
`affirm` is mainly a joke designed to replace `yes` --- a command that infinitely repeats it's input --- with a rust-based version.
## Installation
Make sure you have rust installed and run 
```zsh
% cargo install affirm
```
To make sure it has been installed, run
```zsh
% affirm -V
```
